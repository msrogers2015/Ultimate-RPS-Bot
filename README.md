# Presenting Ultimate RPS Bot!

Lets face it, this is just a bot thats being redone like hundreds of others have. But I've decided to stitch all those bots together into a single bot! Wanna enjoy a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors? Go for it. Found out about Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock from Big Bang Theory? We got that too! Curious about [umop's](https://www.umop.com/rps.htm) variations of the game? Play then without even understanding the speghetti trails.


# RPS3-The Classic
Since theres various versions included in this bot, the name scheme is the standard game followed by the number of options. So RPS3 is the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors

# RPS5 - Nerd Stuff
Did you know about RPSLS when it was first created? Or did the wonderful world of Big Bang Theory introduce you to this updated variation of the classic?

# RPS7 - The Beginning of a Mad Man
David C. Lovelace wasn't satified with the classic nor the updated version of the game. He wanted more and that exactly what he did. [RPS7](https://www.umop.com/rps7.htm) was the start to a something that would become MUCH MUCH bigger.

# RPS9 - Pushing the boundary
Is 7 not enough options? How about [RPS9](https://www.umop.com/rps9.htm). No cheat sheet needed, _yet_.

# What's next?
RPS11, RPS15, RPS25 and RPS101 will be added eventually. The matrix gets harder and harder to create from the outcomes provided by David C. Lovelace. Can't really call myself the Ultimate RPS Bot if I dont include all recoginzed variations out there now can I? If you have any suggestions for variations please create an issue with a link to the option map or something showing all outcomes with their verbage.
